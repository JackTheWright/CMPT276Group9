Server Saturation Test
Date: 2018-07-13

Notes:
    This test does not take into account the connection time over the
    internet as it was run with all nodes in the same network. This is
    mainly a test of server compute time and not network connectivity as
    there is nothing that can be done to improve that.

    Server is running a simple echo handler for all connections. Will 
    need to run another test with a more complicated handler.

Server Configuration:
    CPU:
        2 cores
        6.5 GHz total clock speed
        99% CPU usage for server application
    RAM:
        2 GB
    OS:
        Ubuntu Server 17.10
        VMWare ESXi 6.5

Baseline:
    Average # bytes per transmission: 20
    Connection time from node to server: ~ 3.1 ms

Data:
    # Client Nodes | Run Time (s) | # Transmissions | Time/Trans. (ms)
           1       |      46      |      10 000     |      4.6
           2       |      54      |      10 000     |      5.4
           3       |      63      |      10 000     |      6.3

Projections:
    +1 client node -> ~ +1 ms transmission time

    This can be extrapolated to:
        200 nodes ~= 1s transmission time

    Accommodating for experimental errors, the server should be able to
    handle 100 simultaneous, low bandwidth (<100 bytes) connections in
    its current configuration.

Decision:
    At this time, no server hardware modifications are needed.
